// in this method we will try to follow the LSP in better way
// we will create two divisions of account in one in which deposit is only defined and then the fixed will have this deposit only
// the other class will have withdrawal method and its also a child of the withdrawalonly class 
// so it has both deposit and withdrawal
// now the class of accounts of the used is divided into these two parts
// in one it has both of them 
// thus we are following the principle of LSP
